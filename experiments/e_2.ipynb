      "Oracle’s Miracle Agent is part of its suite of over 50 AI agents integrated into the Fusion Cloud. These agents revolutionize processes in finance, HR, supply chain management, and customer service. For example, Oracle’s document agent can capture data from vendor quotes, translate it, and generate purchase requests. Additionally, it assists with vendor invoices, offering end-to-end automation. [...] A recent survey by LangChain, which surveyed over 1,300 professionals, highlighted key challenges in deploying AI agents. According to the survey, the top concern is performance quality — more than twice as significant as cost or safety. Ensuring that AI agents consistently provide accurate, contextually-appropriate responses is particularly challenging due to the unpredictability of agents using large language models (LLMs) to control workflows.\\nURL: https://medium.com/@elisowski/a-list-of-ai-agents-set-to-dominate-in-2025-028f975c5b99\\n\\nTitle: AI Agents In 2025: What Enterprise Leaders Need To Know - Forbes\\nContent: 2025 will be the year of AI agents.

Imagine a system that drafts replies to emails automatically. This example shows the opportunities and challenges businesses face with AI agents. [...] \"2025 will be the year of the AI agent.\" Wait — didn’t we already say that in 2023? Back then, I talked about chaining AI models in my podcast. The excitement around AI was huge, and by 2024, many companies rushed to try generative AI, with some even using chained models. But many of these projects failed to scale. Why? Because they were test projects that were not integrated into the system infrastructure or were missing guardrails and quality controls.

      "Heading into the New Year, here are some of our thoughts and predictions about how autonomous AI agents are likely to change work — and the workplace — as we know it in 2025. [...] 2025 will be the year multi-agent systems take center stage, moving beyond single-agent applications like sales or service. These orchestrations will tackle high-impact challenges, like building sales or marketing campaigns, that typically require the involvement of multiple business disciplines. Unlike simple copilots, multi-agent systems will collaborate with one another, adapt, and execute — enabling enterprises to solve complex problems with trust and scale.

      "# Netflix Streaming System Design: A Deep Dive\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey everyone!  As a huge Netflix fan (and aspiring software engineer!), I've always been fascinated by the technology behind their seamless streaming experience.  This post dives into the architectural design of Netflix's streaming system, exploring the key components, challenges, and innovative solutions they've implemented. Get ready for a deep dive into the world of scalable video streaming!\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. Content Ingestion and Processing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A. Encoding and Transcoding:**  Netflix doesn't just upload a single video file and call it a day. They use a process called transcoding, where they convert videos into various formats (like H.264, VP9, and the newer, more efficient AV1) and different bitrates.  This is crucial because different devices and network conditions require different video qualities. A high-speed connection can handle a high-bitrate video for crisp detail, while a low-bandwidth connection might need a lower bitrate to avoid buffering.  They leverage cloud-based transcoding services for scalability and efficiency, ensuring they can handle the massive volume of content they process.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **B. Metadata Management:**  Think about all the information associated with a movie or show: title, description, genre, actors, subtitles, and so much more!  Netflix uses robust databases and metadata management systems to keep track of all this information.  This metadata is critical, not only for displaying accurate information to users but also for powering their incredibly sophisticated search and recommendation algorithms.  Accurate and consistent metadata is the backbone of a good user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **C. Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  Imagine trying to stream a movie from a server halfway across the world!  The latency would be unbearable. That's where a Content Delivery Network (CDN) comes in. Netflix uses a massive CDN (likely a combination of providers like Akamai or Fastly) to distribute content to servers all around the globe, caching content closer to users.  This dramatically reduces latency, ensuring smooth streaming regardless of the user's location.  Managing a global CDN is a huge undertaking, requiring sophisticated techniques to ensure content availability and handle traffic spikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Streaming Architecture:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A. Microservices Architecture:**  Netflix doesn't use one monolithic application; instead, they've adopted a microservices architecture. This means breaking down the system into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other.  This approach offers several key advantages: improved scalability (each service can be scaled independently), better maintainability (easier to update and deploy individual services), and increased fault tolerance (failure of one service doesn't bring down the entire system).\n",
      "\n",
      "```mermaid\n",
      "graph LR\n",
      "    A[API Gateway] --> B(Encoding Service);\n",
      "    A --> C(Recommendation Engine);\n",
      "    A --> D(Content Catalog Service);\n",
      "    A --> E(Payment Service);\n",
      "    A --> F(User Profile Service);\n",
      "    B --> G[CDN];\n",
      "    D --> G;\n",
      "    C --> F;\n",
      "    F --> E;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram above shows a simplified representation of the microservices architecture. The API Gateway acts as the central point of entry, routing requests to the appropriate services.  The Encoding Service handles video transcoding, the Recommendation Engine suggests personalized content, the Content Catalog Service manages metadata, the Payment Service handles billing, and the User Profile Service manages user accounts.  The CDN is responsible for delivering the content to users.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **B. API Gateway:** The API Gateway is the gatekeeper of the entire system.  All requests from clients (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.) first go through the API gateway.  It routes requests to the correct microservices, manages traffic flow, and handles security and authentication.  It's a critical component for ensuring the system's performance and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **C. Database Technologies:**  Netflix uses a variety of databases to manage different types of data.  Cassandra, a highly scalable NoSQL database, likely handles user data and streaming analytics.  MySQL, a relational database, might be used for managing content metadata.  The choice of database technology depends on the specific requirements of each service.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **D. Recommendation Engine:**  Netflix's recommendation engine is legendary!  They use sophisticated machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to personalize content suggestions for each user.  This is a complex field involving collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other advanced techniques to predict what a user might want to watch next.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. User Experience and Scalability:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):**  ABR is the magic behind smooth streaming.  It dynamically adjusts the video bitrate based on the user's network conditions.  If the connection is slow, it switches to a lower bitrate to avoid buffering; if the connection improves, it switches to a higher bitrate for better quality.  Protocols like DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) and HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) are commonly used for ABR.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **B. Client-Side Technologies:**  Netflix supports a wide range of devices and platforms, from web browsers to mobile apps to smart TVs.  Maintaining a consistent user experience across all these platforms is a significant challenge, requiring careful development and testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **C. Load Balancing and Autoscaling:**  Netflix handles massive traffic spikes, especially during popular show releases.  They use sophisticated load balancing and autoscaling techniques to distribute traffic across multiple servers and dynamically adjust the number of servers based on demand.  Cloud-based infrastructure and orchestration tools like Kubernetes are essential for this level of scalability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Security and Monitoring:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **A. Content Protection:**  Protecting its content from piracy is paramount for Netflix.  They employ various techniques, including Digital Rights Management (DRM) and watermarking, to prevent unauthorized access and distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **B. Security Best Practices:**  Security is a top priority, encompassing secure coding practices, regular security audits, and robust access control mechanisms throughout the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **C. Monitoring and Logging:**  Netflix has extensive monitoring and logging systems to track system performance, identify issues, and ensure service stability.  This involves collecting and analyzing vast amounts of data to proactively address potential problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Netflix's streaming system is a marvel of engineering, a testament to the power of microservices, cloud computing, and sophisticated algorithms.  Its ability to scale to millions of concurrent users while delivering a high-quality streaming experience is truly impressive.  The system is constantly evolving to meet the demands of a rapidly changing technological landscape, and I'm excited to see what innovations they come up with next!\n",

       "        <p>Imagine billions of hours of streaming content delivered flawlessly to millions of users worldwide. That's the challenge Netflix tackles daily. This post delves into the sophisticated architecture behind Netflix's streaming empire, exploring the key components and innovations that power its seamless global service. We'll uncover the secrets behind their robust and scalable infrastructure, from content ingestion and processing to user experience and security.

       "        <h3>A. Encoding and Transcoding</h3>\n",
       "        <p>Netflix uses a sophisticated transcoding process, converting videos into various formats (H.264, VP9, and the highly efficient AV1) and bitrates.  This ensures optimal playback quality across diverse devices and network conditions. High-speed connections receive high-bitrate videos for crisp detail, while low-bandwidth connections receive lower bitrates to avoid buffering. Cloud-based transcoding services like AWS Elemental MediaConvert or Google Cloud Video Intelligence API provide the scalability and efficiency to handle Netflix's massive content volume.</p>\n",
       "        <h3>B. Metadata Management</h3>\n",
       "        <p>Netflix uses robust database systems, likely employing a combination of relational (like PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data) and NoSQL databases (like Cassandra or MongoDB for scalability and flexibility) to manage metadata. This metadata is crucial for accurate display to users and for powering their sophisticated search and recommendation algorithms. Maintaining data consistency and scalability across a global system presents significant challenges.</p>\n",
       "        <h3>C. Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>\n",
       "        <p>Netflix leverages a massive CDN (like Akamai, Fastly, or a combination) to cache content on edge servers globally. This dramatically reduces latency, ensuring smooth streaming regardless of user location. Managing a global CDN requires sophisticated techniques for content distribution, load balancing, and ensuring high availability.</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "* **A. Encoding and Transcoding:**  Netflix doesn't just upload a single video file and call it a day. They use a process called transcoding, where they convert videos into various formats (like H.264, VP9, and the newer, more efficient AV1) and different bitrates.  This is crucial because different devices and network conditions require different video qualities. A high-speed connection can handle a high-bitrate video for crisp detail, while a low-bandwidth connection might need a lower bitrate to avoid buffering.  They leverage cloud-based transcoding services for scalability and efficiency, ensuring they can handle the massive volume of content they process.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **B. Metadata Management:**  Think about all the information associated with a movie or show: title, description, genre, actors, subtitles, and so much more!  Netflix uses robust databases and metadata management systems to keep track of all this information.

This dramatically reduces latency, ensuring smooth streaming regardless of the user's location.  Managing a global CDN is a huge undertaking, requiring sophisticated techniques to ensure content availability and handle traffic spikes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**II. Streaming Architecture:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **A. Microservices Architecture:**  Netflix doesn't use one monolithic application; instead, they've adopted a microservices architecture. This means breaking down the system into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other.  This approach offers several key advantages: improved scalability (each service can be scaled independently), better maintainability (easier to update and deploy individual services), and increased fault tolerance (failure of one service doesn't bring down the entire system).\n",

       "The diagram above shows a simplified representation of the microservices architecture. The API Gateway acts as the central point of entry, routing requests to the appropriate services.  The Encoding Service handles video transcoding, the Recommendation Engine suggests personalized content, the Content Catalog Service manages metadata, the Payment Service handles billing, and the User Profile Service manages user accounts.  The CDN is responsible for delivering the content to users.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **B. API Gateway:** The API Gateway is the gatekeeper of the entire system.  All requests from clients (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.) first go through the API gateway.  It routes requests to the correct microservices, manages traffic flow, and handles security and authentication.  It's a critical component for ensuring the system's performance and security.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **C. Database Technologies:**  Netflix uses a variety of databases to manage different types of data.  Cassandra, a highly scalable NoSQL database, likely handles user data and streaming analytics.  MySQL, a relational database, might be used for managing content metadata.  The choice of database technology depends on the specific requirements of each service.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **D. Recommendation Engine:**  Netflix's recommendation engine is legendary!  They use sophisticated machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques to personalize content suggestions for each user.  This is a complex field involving collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other advanced techniques to predict what a user might want to watch next.\n",

       "\n",
       "**III. User Experience and Scalability:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **A. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR):**  ABR is the magic behind smooth streaming.  It dynamically adjusts the video bitrate based on the user's network conditions.  If the connection is slow, it switches to a lower bitrate to avoid buffering; if the connection improves, it switches to a higher bitrate for better quality.  Protocols like DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) and HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) are commonly used for ABR.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **B. Client-Side Technologies:**  Netflix supports a wide range of devices and platforms, from web browsers to mobile apps to smart TVs.  Maintaining a consistent user experience across all these platforms is a significant challenge, requiring careful development and testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **C. Load Balancing and Autoscaling:**  Netflix handles massive traffic spikes, especially during popular show releases.  They use sophisticated load balancing and autoscaling techniques to distribute traffic across multiple servers and dynamically adjust the number of servers based on demand.  Cloud-based infrastructure and orchestration tools like Kubernetes are essential for this level of scalability.\n",

They employ a sophisticated transcoding process, converting videos into various formats (H.264, VP9, and the highly efficient AV1) and bitrates. This ensures optimal playback quality across diverse devices and network conditions. High-speed connections receive high-bitrate videos for crisp detail, while low-bandwidth connections receive lower bitrates to avoid buffering. Cloud-based transcoding services like AWS Elemental MediaConvert or Google Cloud Video Intelligence API provide the scalability and efficiency to handle Netflix's massive content volume.\n",

       "* **B. Metadata Management:**  Consider the vast amount of information associated with each movie or show: title, description, genre, actors, directors, subtitles, ratings, release dates, and more. Netflix utilizes robust database systems, likely employing a combination of relational (like PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data) and NoSQL databases (like Cassandra or MongoDB for scalability and flexibility) to manage this metadata.  This metadata is crucial not only for accurate display to users but also for powering their sophisticated search and recommendation algorithms.  Maintaining data consistency and scalability across a global system presents significant challenges, requiring careful data modeling and replication strategies.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **C. Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Streaming a movie from a server halfway across the world would result in unacceptable latency.  Netflix leverages a massive Content Delivery Network (CDN), likely a combination of providers like Akamai, Fastly, and potentially their own custom infrastructure, to cache content on edge servers globally. This dramatically reduces latency, ensuring smooth streaming regardless of user location. Managing a global CDN requires sophisticated techniques for content distribution, load balancing, and ensuring high availability across different regions and during traffic spikes.\n",
